# College 3rd Semester Lab Activities Journey ðŸš€

Well after a long break, I'm back to college and continue my studies about programming.

## About
This repository will serve as my progress during `Object Oriented Programming` course in my 3rd Semester. As always, it will include codes, project files, and compiled files that are created as a part of my study in this course. Feel free to borrow the ideas, learning, or just exploring my projects if you are planning to (for my classmates, don't copy anything from this project please.). 

The techs I use in this project include:

- Programming Languages: Java.
- Apps: Visual Studio Code, Windows Terminal.

Hopefully you can also learn from this repository!
